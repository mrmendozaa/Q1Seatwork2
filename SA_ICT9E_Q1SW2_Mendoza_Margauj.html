		<tr>
			<th colspan="5"><img src="kapitan tiago 2.png" width="60%" height="60%"></th>
			<td colspan="5" >Kapitan Tiago</td>
			<td>Also known as Don Santiago de los Santos, most of the people that knows him think that he is a good person and one that has a kind heart. This is because he is good friends with everyone and donates to people who need it, commonly in the church. </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th colspan="5"><img src="padre damaso.webp" width="60%" height="60%"></th>
			<td colspan="5">Padre Damaso</td>
			<td>A Spanish friar living in the Philippines, Father Dámaso is an arrogant and pedantic priest who, despite having lived amongst Filipinos and hearing their confessions for over twenty years, is barely able to speak or understand Tagalog, the country’s native language.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th colspan="5"><img src="maria clara.jpg" width="60%" height="60%"></th>
			<td colspan="5">Maria Clara</td>
			<td>A devout Roman Catholic who became the epitome of virtue, "demure and self-effacing,” humorless and prone to fainting. Her traits were further described by Rizal as an "Oriental decoration" with "downcast" eyes and a "pure soul".</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th colspan="5"><img src="crisostomo ibarra.webp" width="60%" height="60%"></th>
			<td colspan="5">Juan Crisostomo Ibarra y Magsalin</td>
			<td>A wealthy young man of mixed Spanish and Filipino ancestry who has recently returned to the Philippines from Europe after spending seven years studying abroad. Ibarra is cultured and well-respected, though the friars in his hometown of San Diego are suspicious of him.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th colspan="5"><img src="lieutenant guevarra.webp" width="60%" height="60%"></th>
			<td colspan="5">Tenyente Guevarra</td>
			<td>An elderly lieutenant of the Civil Guard who deeply respects both Ibarra and the late Don Rafael. Guevara tells Ibarra that he appreciated his father’s conviction and moral compass, which went against the church and Father Dámaso’s oppressive dominance. He is also the one to inform Ibarra about what exactly happened between Don Rafael and Father Dámaso.</td>
